WordCloud Project

Welcome to one of my first Python projects! This project was created as part of my initial learning journey in Python.
Project Overview

This WordCloud project allows users to generate a word cloud from a given text. The user can provide their own text or fetch a text from Wikipedia. The generated word cloud is then overlaid onto a black and white image provided by the user.
Features

    Custom Text Input: Users can input a text that they want to visualize in the word cloud.
    Wikipedia Text Fetching: Users can specify a topic, and the project will fetch related text from Wikipedia (note: this feature is currently experiencing issues and may need updates).
    Image Overlay: Users can provide a black and white PNG image to serve as the shape for the word cloud.
    Custom Output: Users can specify the location and name of the output file where the word cloud image will be saved.

How It Works

    Input Text: The user provides a text or specifies a Wikipedia topic to fetch text from.
    Input Image: The user provides a black and white PNG image to use as a mask for the word cloud.
    Generate Word Cloud: The program generates a word cloud based on the input text and overlays it onto the provided image.
    Save Output: The user specifies the output file's location and name, and the word cloud image is saved accordingly.
